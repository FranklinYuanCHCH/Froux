            <p>Solving a Rubik's Cube one-handed can be a challenging but rewarding endeavor. In this step-by-step tutorial, we'll cover fingertricks, basic moves, and introduce the RUL algorithms, as well as discuss the ROUX method, which is considered by many to be one of the best methods for one-handed solving.</p>

            <h2>RUL algorithms</h2>
            <p>One-handed solving can be more efficient with the RUL (Right, Upper, Left) algorithms. These algorithms are designed to minimize cube rotations and finger movements. Learn and practice RUL algorithms to improve your solving speed.</p>

            <h2>ROUX method</h2>
            <p>The ROUX method is a popular choice for one-handed solving due to its efficiency and reduced cube rotations. Here's a brief overview:<br>

                a. First Block: Start by solving the first 2x2x3 block on one side of the cube. This block consists of two layers and three columns. Focus on the right (R), upper (U), and left (L) sides while minimizing cube rotations.<br>
                
                b. Second Block: After completing the first block, move on to the second 2x2x2 block, which is usually located on the opposite side. Maintain the orientation of the solved pieces from the first block to minimize rotations.<br>
                
                c. Last Layer: Finish the solve by orienting and permuting the last layer using one-handed algorithms. The RUL algorithms will be particularly useful here.<br>
                
                d. Practice: Practice the ROUX method to improve your efficiency and speed. It may take time to become proficient, but it's worth the effort.
