            <p>
                a. Choose a color (usually white or yellow) to start with. Your goal is to solve the 3x2x1 block on one side of the cube.<br>

b. Look for your first pair (corner and edge) and insert them into the first block. Try to preserve the orientation of the corners.<br>

c. Continue solving pairs and building the first block until you have a 3x2x1 block on one side.

            <p>
                a. Turn the cube so that the solved first block is on your left and the unsolved part is facing you.<br>

b. Solve the second block, which is the 3x2x1 block on the opposite side of the first block.<br>

c. As you solve the second block, be mindful of preserving the orientation of the corners and edges in the first block.

            <h1>Step 3: CMLL</h1> <br>
            <p>
                a. Once you've solved the first two blocks, you should have the entire cube solved except for the last layer's corners. The goal is to orient all the corners correctly. <br>

b. Learn and use CMLL algorithms to orient the corners. This step ensures that all corners are correctly oriented, and it's done without affecting the edges. <br>

            <h1>Step 4: Edge Orientation</h1> <br>
            <p>
                a. After orienting the corners, you may have some edges misoriented. The goal here is to orient all the edges correctly without worrying about their permutation.<br>

b. Learn EO algorithms to achieve edge orientation. This step will make all the edges in the last layer correctly oriented.<br>

            <h1>Step 5: LR</h1> <br>
            <p>
                a. Now that all your corners and edges are oriented correctly, it's time to permute the last six edges.<br>

b. Solve the last six edges using Roux-specific algorithms. This step involves moving the edges to their correct positions while ignoring the orientation.

            <h1>Step 6: 4C</h1> <br>
            <p>
                a. At this point, your cube should be very close to being solved. You may have four corners in the last layer that need to be permuted correctly.<br>

b. Use 4C algorithms to permute these corners and finish solving the cube.

                Congratulations! You've now successfully solved the Rubik's Cube using the Roux method. Keep practicing to improve your speed and efficiency. Remember that the Roux method is known for its efficiency and fewer moves compared to other methods, making it a popular choice among cubers.
